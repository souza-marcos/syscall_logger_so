neg@neg-VirtualBox:/proc$ sudo cat kallsyms | grep call_table
[sudo] password for neg: 
ffffffff826003a0 D sys_call_table
ffffffff83815c00 d bpf_syscall_table

It was funny, when you type the command without sudo the result is all zeros in address column

$ sudo insmod syscall-steal.ko sym=0x....a0

We have to care about a randomization system that may exists in the kernel
